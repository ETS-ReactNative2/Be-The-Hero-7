This was my first project using NodeJS, React and React Native. I already knew javascript well, but I had never gone too deep into its frameworks. I changed this with the oportunity of participate in the workshop "Semana Omnistack 11", that introduced me all the concepts of this technologies. 

## About the project
This is a complete App, with two front-ends (web and mobile) and a back-end writed using NodeJS. I made this application on my first week in quarantine because coronavirus. It was developed based on video tutorials of the workshop and the official documentation of the frameworks.

The Be The Hero is a project that aims to connect people who wish to make monetary contributions to NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) that need help. It platform works like a goodness marketplace that facilitates the connection between the donor and the organization.

The mobile app is geared towards donors. The interface shows all NGOs, their campaigns and contact information.
The website is made for NGOs, who can register and create their campaigns there.

I learned a lot with this project and the knowledge acquired here was used and improved on all the other upcoming projects that use these technologies.
